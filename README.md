## Description

The effort to promote recovery supportive institutions of higher education across the U.S. includes specific activities designed to better describe the diverse recovery support services and resources that may be available for students and their families. Professionals working to support substance use disorder and mental health (SUD/MH) recovery, as well as educators, parents, and students themselves, need data and information to find and access a variety of recovery support options that are present or emerging around educational institutions. Equally important, public health organizations need to be able to view the national landscape for support and care and see the critically important points of entry for young adults looking to complete educational goals and transition into stable and rewarding recovery lifestyles. 

The SAFE Campuses Collegiate Recovery Census is a targeted survey and data analytics instrument being developed to define and explore the rich spectrum of support resources available for students in recovery at institutions of higher education. Associated national census activities aim to directly support the collection and dissemination of programmatic and relational information to directly assist groups and organizations interested in creating recovery supportive campuses at institutions across the U.S. 

Collegiate recovery program leaders can request technical assistance services directly from the SAFE Campuses team. These services aim to equip leaders with essential tools to create sustainable, impactful, campus communities and initiatives.
